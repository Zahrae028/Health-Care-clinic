Unity Care Clinic – Backend (PHP 8.5 Procedural & MySQLi)
Project Overview

Unity Care Clinic’s backend aims to provide a solid foundation for managing key clinical entities such as patients, departments, and doctors. This first version is built using PHP 8.5 (procedural) and MySQLi, focusing on simplicity, maintainability, and clarity for an initial release.

A central component of this backend is the administration dashboard, which offers administrators a global overview of the clinic’s system through key statistics, charts, and activity summaries. This facilitates better decision-making and efficient supervision of operations.

Core Features
1. Entity Management

Full CRUD operations for major clinic entities:

Patients

Doctors

Departments

Additional requirements:

Entity relationship management (e.g., assign doctors to departments)

Clean interfaces for creating, listing, editing, and deleting records

2. Dashboard & Statistics

A dynamic dashboard will display pertinent system information, including:

Total doctor count, specialties, department performance, etc.

Interactive charts using Chart.js

Optional dynamic refresh for live updates

3. Internationalization (i18n)

Multilingual support via dedicated language files:

fr.php, en.php, es.php, etc.

Users can switch language directly from the dashboard

4. Documentation

All scripts must be properly documented:

Internal comments explaining logic

A complete README (installation, project structure, prerequisites)

Clear and organized folder structure

5. Optional Enhancements (Bonus)

AJAX integration for smooth, asynchronous operations

Modal-based forms for improved UX

Advanced charting and interactive analytics

Performance Criteria
Response Time

Ensure fast and acceptable system-wide response times

Memory Usage

Optimize memory consumption for server efficiency

SQL Optimization

Security Guidelines (PHP Procedural + MySQLi)
SQL Injection Prevention

Use prepared statements

Avoid inline SQL with user input

Data Validation & Sanitization

Validate all incoming data

Escape/sanitize outputs to avoid XSS attacks

Best Practices for PHP Procedural Architecture

DRY Principle: avoid repeating logic; use shared functions

Modularity: separate concerns into reusable modules/files

Naming Conventions: consistent and descriptive naming

Comments: clear documentation for future developers

Error Handling: meaningful error reporting and logging

Database Connection Standards

Store credentials securely (never hard-coded in public files)

Properly open/close database connections

Use prepared statements for all dynamic queries

Implement robust connection-error handling

Avoid unnecessary persistent connections
